BITSS GitHub and gitkraken demo projects.

making a change to our file.

Create repositories on GitHub (not on computer)
Naming conventions: Only lower case, only a-z, only dashes
Assume that anything that goes into GitHub is being revealed to a third party
Github definitely steals your data
Gitignore

.md file is a markdown file (plain text that allows for basic text formatting)
README.md files are automatically displayed because you’re supposed to…read it!
Git doesn’t sync folder structure

WIP in gitkraken stands for work in progress

Commits are local (on your computer).  Push makes them global. 

ORIGIN > FETCH origin is a way to check whether any changes were made on GitHub in the web browser.  It shows them to you, but they aren’t on your machine until you “pull” them.  It does this automatically sometimes, but you can do it manually.

BRANCHES let different people work on different things at the same time. This is a key awesome feature of GitHub.
Different branches can be experimental spaces that you can keep to yourself (don’t PUSH), or you can share it and other people can tinker with the pushed version.

Check next to a branch means it’s checked out

A branch is an access point.  Commits have all the information so you can create and delete branches all you want. Keeping branches clean is important. Create branches at the places you want to go and you delete them if you don’t want to go there anymore.

Branches can be local and/or you can push them too GitHub.

Right pane shows you what is local and what is on the remote.
